    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>
        WeightWatchers faced a critical issue: members were abandoning the program due to outdated digital offerings. 
        The rise of competitors like Fitbit and MyFitnessPal underscored the need for a modernized digital experience.
        <span class="detail">Millions of members still engaged with in-person meetings and weight management programs, but a lack of integration with modern technology left them vulnerable to churn.</span>

    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>
        As Lead Experience Designer, I worked alongside designers, product managers, engineers, and health experts from both Slalom and WeightWatchers to envision and execute a comprehensive cross-platform solution.
        <span class="detail">This included defining user journeys, creating design systems, and ensuring cohesive execution across all teams.</span>

    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Rebuilding the Digital Experience:</strong> 
        We prioritized a user-centered approach to integrate fitness tracking, food logging, and community engagement seamlessly.
        <span class="detail">The first milestone was fast-tracking fitness tracker integration, enabling members to connect devices like Fitbit and Withings to their WeightWatchers account.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Enhancing Food Tracking:</strong> 
        Food tracking was redesigned for ease and engagement. We introduced new features such as favorites, recipes, and a health dashboard to give members actionable insights.
        <span class="detail">Design principles like clarity and positive reinforcement ensured high usability, mitigating the risk of user drop-off due to the high-touch nature of the app.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Empathy-Driven Design:</strong> 
        I immersed myself in the WeightWatchers ecosystem, joining as a member and testing both existing and competitive solutions. This hands-on approach informed design decisions with authentic user perspectives.
        <span class="detail">Participating in user research and testing helped validate our designs, ensuring they met real-world needs.</span>

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <p>
        The Beyond the Scale platform launched successfully ahead of the crucial holiday season. It transformed WeightWatchers' digital offerings into a competitive asset.
        <span class="detail">Key outcomes included increased membership engagement, a revitalized digital ecosystem, and a stronger market position. Additionally, the company attracted notable investments, including Oprah's high-profile involvement.</span>
