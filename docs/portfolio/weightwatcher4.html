    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>
        WeightWatchers faced a critical issue: <span class="detail-1">members were leaving due to outdated digital tools.</span> 
        The rise of competitors like Fitbit and MyFitnessPal highlighted the need for a modernized experience.
        <span class="detail-2">In-person meetings remained a strong feature,</span> 
        <span class="detail-3">but the lack of digital integration left members searching for better solutions.</span>
        <span class="detail-4">This gap risked losing members who sought alternative apps and tools.</span>

    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>
        As Lead Experience Designer, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver a seamless platform upgrade.
        <span class="detail-1">My focus included defining user flows, creating a cohesive design system, and ensuring feature alignment.</span>
        <span class="detail-2">I also developed detailed screen architecture diagrams to enhance team collaboration and clarity.</span>
        <span class="detail-3">Working closely with researchers and developers, I guided design decisions based on user feedback.</span>

        <strong>Phase 0: Fitness Integration:</strong> 
        <span class="detail-1">We prioritized fitness tracker integration as the most pressing need.</span> Members could now sync devices like Fitbit, eliminating app-switching.

    <h4>UI & Visual Design Exploration</h4>
    <p>
        Working with talented supporting UI and visual designers, we explored a wide range of options, from subtle refinements to bold reimaginings. 
        <span class="detail-1">Some designs adhered to the existing WeightWatchers brand, while others ventured into entirely new territory.</span>
        <span class="detail-2">Ultimately, we implemented a simple and elegant style guide, designed for forwards compatibility with future applications.</span>
        <span class="detail-3">This foundational approach proved invaluable as it became the basis for WeightWatchers' next phase of digital work, ensuring consistency and scalability.</span>
