    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>
        WeightWatchers faced a critical issue: <span class="detail-1">members were abandoning the program due to outdated digital offerings.</span> 
        The rise of competitors like Fitbit and MyFitnessPal underscored the need for a modernized digital experience.
        <span class="detail-2">Millions of members still engaged with in-person meetings and weight management programs,</span> 
        <span class="detail-3">but a lack of integration with modern technology left them vulnerable to churn.</span>
    </p>

    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>
        As Lead Experience Designer, I worked alongside designers, product managers, engineers, and health experts from both Slalom and WeightWatchers to envision and execute a comprehensive cross-platform solution.
        <span class="detail-1">This included defining user journeys, creating design systems, and ensuring cohesive execution across all teams.</span>
        <span class="detail-2">I also contributed detailed screen architecture diagrams to ensure clarity and alignment across the project.</span>

        <strong>Phase 0: Fitness Integration:</strong> 
        <span class="detail-1">We fast-tracked an app enabling fitness tracker integration, addressing the most urgent need.</span>
        Members could connect devices like Fitbit and Withings to their WeightWatchers account, eliminating the need to switch between apps.
        <span class="detail-2">The backend portal supported syncing and offered a dashboard showing fitness activity,</span>
        <span class="detail-3">rewarding users with tangible benefits such as dietary allowances based on activity.</span>

        <strong>Phase 2: Dietary Tracking Redesign:</strong> 
        Food tracking was redesigned for clarity and engagement, introducing features like favorites, recipes, and a health dashboard.
        <span class="detail-2">This phase ensured a more comprehensive view of members' health activities.</span>

        <strong>Phase 3: Social & Coaching Support:</strong> 
        New features, such as integrated coaching and social interaction tools, fostered stronger community ties among members.
        <span class="detail-3">These tools provided ongoing support to reinforce healthy habits and motivate users.</span>

        I immersed myself in the WeightWatchers ecosystem, joining as a member and testing both existing and competitive solutions.
        <span class="detail-1">This hands-on approach informed design decisions with authentic user perspectives.</span>
        <span class="detail-2">In addition to joining as a member, I conducted in-person and digital research sessions, gathering feedback to refine designs and prioritize features effectively.</span>

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <p>
        The Beyond the Scale platform launched successfully ahead of the crucial holiday season. 
        <span class="detail-1">It transformed WeightWatchers' digital offerings into a competitive asset.</span>
        <span class="detail-2">Key outcomes included increased membership engagement, a revitalized digital ecosystem, and a stronger market position.</span>
        <span class="detail-3">Additionally, the company attracted notable investments, including Oprah's high-profile involvement.</span>
